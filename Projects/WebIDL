The modern web is becoming an application platform in addition to its
function as a distributed document store. Instead of native operating
system interfaces, the web browser exposes JavaScript APIs with
various restrictions. We would like OCaml software to be able to
easily transition between a native application and a web application.
To accomplish this, a representation for browser interfaces is
required.

This project would involve the development of a parser of WebIDL, a
W3C standard interface specification language
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/>, and a set of rules for mapping WebIDL
signatures to OCaml interfaces. Further work could include the
development of a js_of_ocaml binding generator or generated interface
constraint assertions. These developments would help the OCaml
community keep our interfaces up-to-date with the latest web API
advancements and provide universal interfaces for common device
capabilities like hardware-accelerated 3D rendering and device sensor
support.
