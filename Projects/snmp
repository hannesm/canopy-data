MirageOS 3 uses logging (via the `logs` library, exfiltrating on console or via
syslog).  But we don't have a monitoring solution.

It would be great to have a lightweight (effect-free, minimal dependencies) [SNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP) library developed purely in OCaml.

The [asn1-combinators](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-asn1-combinators) library is a good start for SNMP marshalling.

Further steps include to add stats counters to our libraries (network interface, tcp stack, ...).  We could then have a monitoring story by using off-the-shelf tools to collect the counters and compute statistics.

[RFC 6353](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6353) specifies TLS transport for SNMP, useful for an open environment (and for setting values, which you may want to do only after authentication).
