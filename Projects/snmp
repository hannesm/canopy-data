MirageOS 3 uses logging (via the `logs` library, exfiltrating on console or via
syslog).  But there is no monitoring solution for MirageOS.

From an abstract view, a small library for MirageOS, which lets device and
protocol implementors describe counter and gauge names and values (independent
of the wire format) together with libraries transforming these values into
specific wire formats ([SNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP),
[munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/), json,
[mrtg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher),
[prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) ([OCaml
library](https://github.com/mirage/prometheus)), ..)  would fit well into
MirageOS.  This allows a device or protocol implementor to describe data, but
the operator to decide whether and how to use the data.

Both the small library and extending wire format support with SNMP would be nice
to have for MirageOS.  Both libraries should be lightweight (effect-free,
minimal dependencies) developed purely in OCaml with a reasonable sized test
suite and fuzz-based testing.

The SNMP library on its own could come with some demonstration samples, such
as `snmpwalk`.

The [asn1-combinators](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-asn1-combinators)
library is a good start for SNMP marshalling.

An extension for SNMP is to use a TLS transport (in [RFC
6353](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6353)), which is useful for an open
environment and for setting configuration values after successful
authentication.
